# Project Vox Showcase

A minimal template of Project Vox for demonstration. This version mirrors the core structure of the main project while keeping data and logs empty so it can be shared or forked.

## Structure

- `spanish/` – template vocabulary tracker and weekly log for Spanish.
- `mandarin/` – template vocabulary tracker and weekly log for Mandarin.
- `prompts/` – reusable prompts for ChatGPT batch tests and drills.

To use, copy the templates out of this directory and start filling in your own progress.
